    <section id="basics">
        <h2>Basics of Mechanical Design</h2>
        <p>Mechanical design involves creating, analyzing, and optimizing mechanical systems. Start with fundamentals like sketching, material selection, and prototyping. Key principles: stress analysis, ergonomics, and sustainability.</p>
        <p><strong>Beginner Tip:</strong> Use free tools like FreeCAD for practice. Hero Upgrade: Integrate FEA (Finite Element Analysis) for simulations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cad-intro">
        <h2>Introduction to CAD (CAO)</h2>
        <p>CAD (Computer-Aided Design) is software for 2D/3D modeling. It streamlines design from concept to production. Benefits: precision, collaboration, and error reduction.</p>
        <p><strong>Getting Started:</strong> Learn basic commands like extrude, revolve, and assemblies. Resources: Online tutorials on YouTube or Autodesk's free trials.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="catia">
        <h2>CATIA V5</h2>
        <p>CATIA V5 is a powerful CAD tool for complex assemblies, used in aerospace and automotive industries. Features: parametric modeling, surface design, and DMU (Digital Mock-Up).</p>
        <p><strong>Tutorial Path:</strong> Start with Part Design workbench for basic shapes. Advance to Assembly for multi-part systems. Hero Level: Use Knowledgeware for automation.</p>
        <p>Example Workflow: Model an aircraft wing â€“ sketch profiles, extrude, and analyze aerodynamics.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="solidworks">
        <h2>SolidWorks</h2>
        <p>SolidWorks is user-friendly CAD for mechanical design, popular in prototyping. Strengths: intuitive interface, simulation tools, and PDM integration.</p>
        <p><strong>From 0 to Hero:</strong> Begin with sketches and features. Add motion studies for mechanisms. Advanced: API scripting for custom tools.</p>
        <p>Use Case: Design a car engine block with tolerances and material properties.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gibbscam">
        <h2>GibbsCAM</h2>
        <p>GibbsCAM is CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software for CNC machining. It bridges design to production, supporting mills, lathes, and multi-task machines.</p>
        <p><strong>Basics:</strong> Import CAD models, define toolpaths. Hero Upgrade: Optimize for 5-axis machining in aeronautics.</p>
        <p>Application: Program toolpaths for aerospace turbine blades.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="featurecam">
        <h2>FeatureCAM</h2>
        <p>FeatureCAM automates CAM programming with feature recognition. Ideal for repetitive manufacturing in automotive and mechanical parts.</p>
        <p><strong>Start Here:</strong> Learn feature-based machining. Advanced: Integrate with SolidWorks for seamless workflows.</p>
        <p>Example: Automate drilling and milling for automobile chassis components.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="aerospace">
        <h2>Aerospace Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Aerospace mechanics focuses on aircraft structures, propulsion, and aerodynamics. CAD tools like CATIA excel here for lightweight, durable designs.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Topics:</strong> Composite materials, fatigue analysis, and regulatory standards (e.g., FAA). Hero: Simulate hypersonic flight conditions.</p>
        <p>Integration: Use CATIA for fuselage modeling and GibbsCAM for precision machining.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="automobile">
        <h2>Automobile Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Automobile mechanics covers vehicle design, engines, and chassis. SolidWorks is great for prototyping suspensions and transmissions.</p>
        <p><strong>Essentials:</strong> NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness) analysis, crash simulations. Advanced: Electric vehicle battery pack design.</p>
        <p>Workflow: Model a full car assembly in SolidWorks, then export to FeatureCAM for manufacturing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="aeronautics">
        <h2>Aeronautics</h2>
        <p>Aeronautics emphasizes flight dynamics, avionics, and propulsion systems. Overlaps with aerospace but focuses on lighter-than-air and unmanned vehicles.</p>
        <p><strong>Design Focus:</strong> Wing aerodynamics, stability controls. Hero Level: CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) integration.</p>
        <p>Tools: CATIA for 3D modeling drones or gliders, GibbsCAM for custom parts.</p>
